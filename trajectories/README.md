There are two examples of datasets in this directory.

* `fpv_uzh` Trajectories derived from the original dataset at https://fpv.ifi.uzh.ch/datasets/. These trajectories are processed such that they are sampled at fixed frquency of 10Hz. However, it can be resampled using the `resample_trajectory.py` at any desired sampling time.
* `gazebo` Trajectories generated from PX4-Gazebo simulation.
